Chronux is an open-source software package being developed for the analysis of neural data. It is a collaborative
research effort based at the Mitra Lab in Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory that has grown out of the work of several
groups. Chronux routines may be employed in the analysis of both point process and continuous data, ranging from
preprocessing, exploratory and confirmatory analysis. Chronux is currently implemented as a Matlab toolbox.

The Chronux website at http://chronux.org/ is the central location for information about the current and all previous
releases of Chronux. The home page contains links to pages for downloads, people, recent news, tutorials, various files,
documentation and our discussion forum. There are also Google groups for Chronux discussion and Chronux announcements
which you can join.  See also "Observed Brain Dynamics", Partha Mitra and Hemant Bokil, Oxford University Press, New York, 2008.

Chronux is an open source project released under the GNU Public License GPL v2.
