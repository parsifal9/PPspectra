#' Two samples of viral integration sites.
#'
#' A dataset containing viral integration sites.  The aim here is to compare the viral
#' integration pattern under two different laboratory protocols, termed London and Paris.
#' Hematopoietic stem cells mobilized in a 7-year-old male pediatric oncology patient
#' using G-CSF and chemotherapy were CD34-selected. All cell stocks used in this study
#' were no longer required for clinical application, and available for research under a
#' Human Research Ethics approval at the Children’s Hospital at Westmead. CD34 + cells
#' were transduced with independent batches of MGMT-encoding MFG-based γ-retroviral
#' vectors collected from the supernatant of PG13 producer cells. Vector stocks for the
#' London conditions were serum-free, containing 1% human serum albumin. Vector stocks for
#' the Paris conditions contained 4% FCS. For full details see "Coherence Analysis
